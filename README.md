**DataFlow-WebUI** is a full-stack open-source web application that provides a graphical interface for the [DataFlow](https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow) framework. This guide walks you through setting up both the frontend and backend so you can quickly get up and running.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* **Python 3.10+**
* **pip**
* **Git**
* A Unix-like shell (Linux/macOS) or PowerShell / CMD (Windows)

---

## Clone This Repository

First, clone the **DataFlow-WebUI** repository and enter the project directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow-WebUI.git
cd DataFlow-WebUI
```

---

## Frontend Installation

The frontend is built with Node.js. We recommend using **NVM (Node Version Manager)** to manage your Node.js version.

### 1. Install NVM

```shell
# Download from GitHub
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

# Mirror download (recommended if you are in China)
curl -so- https://gitee.com/mirrors/nvm/raw/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Reload your shell configuration

After installing NVM, restart your terminal or run one of the following commands:

```shell
# For bash
source ~/.bashrc

# For zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 3. Install and use Node.js 20

```shell
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
nvm alias default 20
```

### 4. Verify Node.js and npm versions

Ensure that Node.js is version `v20.x.x`:

```shell
node -v
npm -v
```

---

## Backend Installation

The backend is powered by **DataFlow** and FastAPI.

### 1. Install DataFlow

You can install DataFlow in **one of two ways**:

#### Option A: Install the latest development version from GitHub

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow
cd DataFlow
pip install -e .
```

#### Option B: Install the stable release from PyPI (recommended for most users)

```shell
pip install open-dataflow
```

### 2. Install backend dependencies for DataFlow-WebUI

From the project root directory, run:

```shell
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

---

## Environment Variables (Optional)

The project supports optional environment variables to override default configurations. A `.env.example` file is provided in the repository root as a template. You can copy it to `.env` or set these variables in your environment.

### Frontend
- **`VITE_BACKEND_URL`**: Base URL for API requests in production. Defaults to `/`.

### Backend
Backend settings are managed by Pydantic and can be overridden by environment variables:
- **`ENV`**: Environment mode (default: `dev`).
- **`CORS_ORIGINS`**: Allowed CORS origins (e.g., `["http://localhost"]`).
- **`ENABLE_DATASETS_API`**: Enable/disable the datasets API (default: `true`).
- **`ENABLE_HF_API`**: Enable/disable the Hugging Face compatibility API (default: `true`).
- **Path Configurations**: You can override default data and cache paths (`DATA_REGISTRY`, `CACHE_DIR`, etc.). See `.env.example` for the full list.
- **Dynamic Variables**: API keys (like OpenAI or Hugging Face tokens) are dynamically injected at runtime during pipeline execution based on the user payload or registry configuration.

---

## Running the Project

### 1. Build the frontend

```shell
cd frontend/
npm install
npm run build
```

This will generate the production-ready frontend assets.

### 2. Start the application

You can use the provided startup scripts from the root directory:

* **On Linux / macOS:**

```shell
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

* **On Windows:**

```shell
./start.bat
```

> 💡 These scripts will load configuration from a `.env` file if it exists. By default, the application runs on port `8000`.

---

## Access the Web UI

Once the backend is running, open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:8000/
```

> 💡 If you changed the backend port, replace `8000` with your custom port.

---

## 🎉 You’re All Set!

You should now have the full DataFlow-WebUI stack running locally. If you encounter issues, double-check your Node.js and Python versions, and feel free to open an issue on GitHub.

Happy hacking! 🚀
